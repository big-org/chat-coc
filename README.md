# Chat room code of conduct 

As every group over the entire internet, we would love to keep delivering meaningful contents and discussions and not to piss everyone off with spam messages/link and-or so called stickers.

### What if you spam?
- We will just delete the contents and warn you.
- We shall block you forever on the next attempt.

### What if I wanted to post something and I doubt whether it is okay here?
- Ask any admins (Private Message)

### What if I see any spam message before admins?
- Notify admins by mentioning them in chat.
